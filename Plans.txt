Current plans

Make all messages inside the bot imported from a file to allow customization, language changes, and more.

Currency system with:
-Raffles
-Voting
-Games
-Earn currency based off:
--time spent in channel while streaming
--number of streams watched consecutively
--amount chatted over certain amount of time
--Attempt to check for "spammy" chat and not count that (unlikely)

Add more to ChatFilter:
-Banned words
-Banned topics
-Detect trolling
-New users (auto-ban users with < {configurable} days on twitch

Chat encouragement system:
-Start conversations with a topic generator (possibly configurable)
-Setup convo between certain people with something like "/sharedrink"

User management
-Change !mod and !unmod to actually /mod and /unmod users to sync Twitch with the bot

Media management:
-Autocreate clips/highights given a timeframe
-Auto detect uptime
-Allow sending tweets from chat

Timmed messages:
-Manage based on time, configurable in seconds
-Cycle through a list file containing messages like "Check out my twitter" or "Join my discord!"

Trigger messages:
-Customizable to send a message in chat if a user:
--Follows
--Subs
--Donates
--Sends bits

Game integration: (Highly unlikely)
-Get stats for splatoon if a webhook is available
-Get stats for destiny character
