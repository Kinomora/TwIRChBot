(probably more stuff too)

0.10.1.0-Alpha:
~Reworte the FileManager class to be constructed with the current working directory allowing me to pass in the directory and file name variables easier
~Fixed all the code in the main and utils classes that broke with redesigning the filemanager class

0.10.0.0-Alpha:
+Actually figured out how to update the TextArea from botUtils >->'
+You can now swap between channels easily by updating the channel textbox and pressing "Update and reconnect"
+Same goes for bot account if you have the username + oauth available

0.9.8.2-Alpha:
+Added isBroadcaster() check to the links filter
~Modified command checking algorithm to ignore character case

0.9.8.1-Alpha:
~Corrected my stupidity with timeout and whispers *facepalm*

0.9.8-Alpha:
-All hard-coded commands excepts !addcmd !help !mods !admins and !version
+Basic link filter to prevent non-"staff" from posting malicious links, purges them, then whispers them why
+Long-message filter. Any message (received) over 256 characters gets purged, then whispered why
+!reload command which clears the commands lists and re-reads the file (for live editing)
+!addcmd with support for adding optional help text or not (seems to cause case-sensitivity)
+Mods can !setmulti again
>>If !setmulti is not followed by a user, the multi is cleared
+"help" commands now work. All commands can have their "!" replaced with "?" for simple information about commands
+Began coding replacement text for <multi>, <first>, and <second> variables in the commands folder, currently only <multi>works.
~Woomies are currently being transferred over to a currency-based system
~!mods and !admins are currently disabled. I need to re-add that handling code into the new system

ideas:
"banned phrases" text file for filtering personal info, memes, and copy-pastas
when a mod/admin does !cmds PM's them commands available to them
